Great questions.  There is no need for a UI and just the basic Java classes is perfectly fine here. Storing the contacts in-memory in Java collections is great, no need for a database or other external persistence system.


Hi Justin,

Few questions from Oleksandr so far:
• Should any UI be implemented?
• Where contacts supposed to be stored – in memory (e.g. collections) or in database?

Thanks,
Alex


Attached are two files, Contact.java and ContactsApplication.java.  The first is a definition of a basic Contact that the application will store and the second is the interface that you need to implement to make the Contacts application work. You will notice that the getContact and search methods have ... in their signature, meaning you need to define the signature.

Feel free to ask any questions and have fun.

Best,
Justin
